## Purpose of the Project
My Grocery Pal is an application that automates and innovates the grocery shopping experience by offering store options based on user needs. Users provide their personal grocery list, and My Grocery Pal will quickly offer store options, enough to tailor any current user demand. These options can range from cheapest price, to closest location, or even to the best reviewed local stores.

## Our Branching Strategy

We are following GitHub Flow:
1. To work on a new feature, create a branch off of the master branch. The branch name should be descriptive so that itâ€™s clear for others. 
2. Make a commit locally whenever we update a file, and add a meaningful commit message explaining the changes.
3. Code review by other members.
4. After it has been thoroughly reviewed, we can merge the branch to the master branch. If there is a merge conflict, then resolve conflicts through GitLab, or resolve it manually/locally.
